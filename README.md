# ECE271-DesignProject

Group members: I am placing all useful reference files and examples in a "Notes and Examples" folder. Feel free to add to this or use it for your work.

[Update by Chris]
    I put in a parser that should work for all of the key board types, the major decoding will be done prior with this in mind. Before we submit, I might have to redraw this to include seperate registers and key_decoders (refer to TopLevelSchematic.pdf) for each keyboard input. I am still determining whether or not we will need a seperate FSM for this.
